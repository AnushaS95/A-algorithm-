# A-algorithm-
A* algorithm implemented for 8 puzzle problem .
Implement	A*	to	solve	8-puzzle	problem.	
1 Compare two	different	heuristics: (a)	Manhattan	distance (b)	another	heuristic found	in	
literature that	claimed	to	improve	on	this		State	the	second	heuristic	you	choose	to	use clearly.	
Run	experiments	with	three	problem	instances,	each	solved	with	2	heuristic	functions,	
report	the	solution	found	and	the	search	cost	measured	by	#nodes	generated.
2 Implement Anytime	A*.	Try	it	with	four	different w	values,	record	the	results	you	get.	
Show	the	multiple	different	solutions	found	by	the	anytime	A*	as	search	time (measured	
by	#nodes	generated)	increases,	report the	quality	of	each	solution	found.
